# DAO-NET

DAO-NET is the open source software component of an antifragile decentralized network of algorithmic DAOs that will collectively form an alternative parallel economy.

## Background

DAO-NET was conceived as a response to the Covid-19 lockdowns, which took a devastating financial toll on individuals, families and small businesses. Coinciding with the largest transfer of wealth from the general population to the elite 0.1%, was the massive erosion by governments of fundamental freedoms that have long been taken for granted in Western societies. 

Whether by design, such as the World Economic Forum’s published Great Reset agenda, or due to government incompetence the old global order is in decline while a more authoritarian global order is currently on the rise. Those who seek to dissent against the new authoritarian trajectory are regularly marginalized, slandered, censored and “canceled”.

The Canadian government’s draconian response to the peaceful protests of the Freedom Convoy, in which the government invoked emergency retroactive laws to coerce fundraising sites, banks and even crypto DEXes to seize donations and imprison organizers, has become the hallmark of the new authoritarian era tactics deployed to suppress dissent.

While the World Economic Forum has identified the decline of the existing economic and political order as an unique opportunity to push forward their centralized authoritarian vision, there is an equal opportunity to push forward a more decentralized libertarian vision. To be a viable alternative the decentralized vision must be demonstrably functional and to have more desirable outcomes than the authoritarian vision.

DAO-NET is explicitly designed to demonstrably allow individuals to organize and fundraise in a maximally decentralized fashion that is antifragile in the sense that authoritarian governments will have difficulty in disrupting the network and the more they seek to disrupt the network the more the requirement for such a decentralized network becomes apparent thus attracting more users.

## Goals
- Facilitation of DAO revolution
  - Provide tools for easy DAO creation and organization
  - Provide many options for DAO funding 
  - Provide a network for DAO easy interactions with other DAOs
  - Create initial core DAOs that will facilitate the evolution of DAO-NET and serve as examples
- Antifragile
  - No Central Owners or Managers that can be coerced into shutting down any aspect of the network
  - Algorithmic instead of Manager based DAOs
  - No centralized servers that can be shut down 
  - All code to be Open Source
  - Funding via smart contracts instead of centralized services
- Decentralized over Democratic Decision Making
  - Allow for many divergent decisions instead of majority rule
  - Funding to be proportional to overall support instead of winners take all
  - DAOs should diverge into many variations and those with little long term support should naturally fade away allowing the rest to thrive
- Inclusive
  - Globally available, although internet access is required
  - No network-wide ban capability, although specific DAOs within the network can be exclusionary
  - Multilingual
  - Participation incentives sufficient to allow individuals to not only cover any transaction fee and internet connection costs but to earn enough surplus to end extreme poverty (~$3 USD per day)
  - Radical transparency so that everyone has sufficient information to fully participate
- Anonymous Self Sovereign Identity
  - User ability to interact anonymously while still able to provide proof that they are a unique living human being (to filter out bots and sybil attacks)
